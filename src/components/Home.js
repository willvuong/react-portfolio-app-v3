                        <p>
                            I am a Computer Programming graduate from Seneca College.
                            Throughout my program, I have demonstrated my ability to code in many
                            programming languages, such as: JavaScript, Java, C, and C++. I also
                            understand database technologies and have the ability to create simple
                            and complex SQL queries. And lastly, I understand the practices in order
                            to meaningfully gather business and system requirement needs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I especially have an interest in Front-End Web Development and enjoy
                            designing simple but yet meaningful websites. I have a good understanding of
                            the React framework and enjoy developing with its useful and easy to use tools.
